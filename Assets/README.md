# Welcome to the unity TopDown2DRPGTemplate.

This is a in-development template that is intended to quicken up the process of creating a top down 2D unity game.
It features:
	- 2D Character Controller
	- Cinemachine Camera System
	- A* Pathfinding NPCs that can Roam, Patrol, and Persue. (albiet a bit broken)
	- Inventory system (courtesy of PitilT on youtube: youtube.com/watch?v=v4Xqj0sanyU)
	- Very simple combat
	- Dialogue System
	- Player can be hurt and heal at campfires.
	- Basic tilemap
	- Basic User Interface
	- Hurt/Death voice lines made by yours truely :)

I have tried to write comments at the top of each script detailing what it does as verbosely as possible, except the inventory / item scripts. 
I would suggest watching the video linked above for more information.

## Setup
Download the project and open it up, if there are any package based errors, please refer below.

### Required Plugins:
NavMeshPlus: https://github.com/h8man/NavMeshPlus.git
    - Goto the unity package manager and click the `+` button and `Add from Git URL` and paste in the url above.
A* PathFinding: https://arongranberg.com/astar/download
    - Goto the url above and click `Download` under the `Free Version`. Then drag and drop the downloaded `*.UnityPackage` file into the template project.
Cinemachine: Find on Unity Package Manager
    - Goto the Unity Registry section of the package manager, find `Cinemachine` and install!

## Future development
The development of this project will mostly coincide with the development of my personal project, and any of the features that I implement that can be abstracted I will most likely add to this project under a different branch. I aim to transfer my Cutscene and Quest system. However this may prove difficult as I will need to figure out how to fit everythings together.

# Upgrading from one template to another
Currently it is not recommended to transfer an existing project from one template to another. (how would you even do that? ðŸ¤·)

Many thanks,

Tayler "Upsilon" Parsons
